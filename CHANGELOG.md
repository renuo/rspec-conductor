## [1.0.10] - TBD

- Add --print-slowest cli param to display the slowest specs in the suite

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-01

- Handle workers stdout/stderr better. It is no longer necessary to use --verbose to see worker output. Verbose now only controls whether you see the debug output of the workers
- For the fancy formatter, allocate one line per stdout/stderr. Not ideal, but I'm not sure what layout I'm even looking for here, since allowing to freely put stuff into stdout/stderr breaks the TUI completely
- Disable echo when running (also breaks the TUI). The side effect of this is that you probably lose ability to tactically use binding.irb in your specs, but you might want to drop into the regular rspec to do that anyway
- Way better handling of SIGINT / Ctrl-C. Child processes used to just crash when terminated via signal, now they're safely terminating
- Support double Ctrl-C to force-kill the workers (same as rspec)
- When there are spec failures, include a rerun command for failed examples (e.g. `rspec spec/some_spec.rb:28 spec/other_spec.rb:42`). It should also be possible to use rspec-conductor for those, but in my personal practice, I prefer rspec because I also want to have some interactive console during the spec run, which is not going to be possible with forked children

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-18

- When --postfork-require is provided, use current dir instead of spec/
- Make sure before(:suite) hooks are actually called

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-16

- Move all output code into the formatter base class (lay some groundwork to address some minor issues with the fancy formatter)
- Disable rspec's --require command line parameter. Use --prefork-require and --postfork-require in the rspec-conductor cli instead (reported by @cb341)

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-14

- Better RSpec arguments handling, for example, --pattern and --exclude-pattern should be supported better (reported by @cb341)
- Add support for RSpec path inclusion filters (e.g. spec/hello_spec.rb:123 or spec/hello_spec.rb[1:2:1])

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-13

- Missed one more place where unqualified `Rails` was still shadowed by `RSpec::Rails`

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-12

- use Etc.nprocessors to determine the default worker count (reported by @coorasse)
- use env vars (RSPEC_CONDUCTOR_DEFAULT_WORKER_COUNT, RSPEC_CONDUCTOR_FIRST_IS_1) more consistently between the rake task and the cli. Meaning, if you set these env vars, you should also see the corresponding change in the cli defaults
- Fix some rake task issues in CI (reported by @cb341)
- Fix namespace clash with RSpec::Rails in the rake task (reported by @cb341)

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-08

- rake tasks for database preparation
- some internal retooling for terminal ui inner machinery (mostly affecting the `fancy` formatter)


## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-09

- Fix --postfork-require options
- Fix worker crashes counter

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-21

- Fix spec_helper/rails_helper path finding [Thanks @diego-aslz]
- Add --prefork-require and --no-prefork-require CLI options for non-rails apps or rails setups where loading config/application.rb is not entirely safe
- Add --postfork-require and --no-postfork-require CLI options for flexibility

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-21

- Initial release
